# Research Paper: Comparative Analysis of Transformer and Seq2Seq Models

## Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and results associated with the research paper titled **"Comparative Analysis of Transformer and Seq2Seq Models for NLP Tasks."** In this research, we explore the performance, strengths, and limitations of Transformer models and Seq2Seq models in natural language processing tasks.

This work was inspired and guided in part by the Kaggle notebook, [Seq2Seq Machine Translation with Attention](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pashupatigupta/seq2seq-machine-translation-with-attention), which provided insights into implementing Seq2Seq models with attention mechanisms.

## Repository Contents
- **Data/**: Contains the datasets used for training and evaluating the models.
- **Models/**
  - **transformer_model.pth**: Transformer model trained from scratch during the research.
  - **seq2seq_model.pth**: Seq2Seq model trained from scratch during the research.
- **Paper/**
  - **research_paper.pdf**: The full research paper with detailed explanations, results, and conclusions.
- **Graphs/**
  - **loss_graph.png**: A graph showing the loss over time for both models during training.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers library (for Transformer models)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)

### Training and Running the Models
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Train the models from scratch:
   ```bash
   python train_transformer.py
   python train_seq2seq.py
   ```
4. Test the trained models:
   ```bash
   python test_transformer.py
   python test_seq2seq.py
   ```

### Data
The data used for training and evaluating the models can be found in the `Data/` directory. This includes preprocessed text files and additional details on the dataset composition in `README_data.md`.

## Results
The research highlights the following key findings:
- **Model Performance**: The Transformer model demonstrated strong performance after being trained from scratch, outperforming the Seq2Seq model on specific NLP tasks.
- **Training Efficiency**: The loss graph (`Graphs/loss_graph.png`) demonstrates the convergence rates for both models during training from scratch.
